# U-GrNet

1. This is a matlab implementation of our article.

2. Since our implementation is based on the source code of GrNet and U-spdnet, we would like to express our sincere thanks to the published official code of [1][2].

4. To run our network, you need to download the CG dataset and place it in the path ".\data". Then, run grnet_afew.m to obtain the classification results.  
   You can download the CG dataset via the following link: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1_62w4nkxNM52bvzjIJVe6A
